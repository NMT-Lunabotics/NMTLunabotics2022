## Do NOT use this launch file
It is for testing purposes only right now, node fails to launch since it expects a command line argument. Perhaps later we could map this argument to parameter on the parameter server or make it fixed to something like "motor controller". 

Nontheless this is useful as an example, since later we may want to extend this to launch multiple nodes.
