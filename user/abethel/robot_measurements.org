* Base-link

  x :: from the back to the front of the robot.
  y :: from the right to the left of the robot.
  z :: from the bottom of the bottom plate to the top of the robot.

  base link 28cm in x, 18cm in y from baseplate corner. (28, 18, 0) =
  (0, 0, 0) relative.

* Dump component

  dump right (DUR) base y = 5cm, x = 56cm, z = 5cm. (56, 5, 5) = (28,
  -13, 5)

  dump left (DUR) base y = 5cm, x = 56cm, z = 5cm. (56, ~, 5) = (28,
  13, 5)

  dump right base -> dump right block: 7cm - (5cm from other end,
  where total len = 80cm) 75cm.

  dump rise = 25cm, run = 41cm. angle = 59Â°.

* Pitch component

  forward pitch hinge : z = 16.5cm, x = 61.5cm. y = 18cm. (61.5, 18,
  16.5) = ()

  Rear pitch pivot motor: x = -10cm, z = 28cm, y = 18cm.

  Minimum pitch length from pivot = 36cm. Pitch pivot attachment ->
  forward pitch hinge = 37cm.

*** Augur component

    forward pitch hinge -> depth motor axle = 8.5 in Y.

    Depth motor axle = 52 cm. Travel = 48 cm.

    Augur tip -> augur hole = 71 cm. Augur hole -> depth motor top =
    16 cm x, 11 y.

* Locomotion component

  Right: y = 9cm, x = 6.5cm, z = 7cm.

  Left: y = ~, x = 6.5cm, z = 21cm.
